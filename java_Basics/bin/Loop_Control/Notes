                                              While Loop
                                              
          1) May be a single statement or block of statement and condition may be expression.
          2) When executing if the boolean expression result is true, then the action inside the loop
           will be executed. This will continue as long as the expression result is true.
          
          
          
          
                                               For Loop
                                               
          A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that
           needs to be executed a specific number of times.
          A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.
          
          for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update) {
   // Statements
}

                                                  Do While Loop
                                                  
          A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at
           least one time.
           do {
                 // Statements
              }
              while(Boolean_expression);
              
           
                                                   Enhanced For Loop
                                                   
           This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.
           for(declaration : expression) {
                   // Statements
                 }
