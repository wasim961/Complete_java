                                Primitive Data Types
                        
          byte:   8 bit signed two's compliment. max value: 2^7-1
          short:  16 bit two's complement. 2 times smaller than integer. max valu: 2^15-1
          int:  32 bit signed two's complement. max value: 2^31-1
          long: 64 bit signed two's compliment intger, max value: 2^63-1
          float:  32 bit float is mainly used for saved memory in large arrays of floating point numbers
          default value : 0.0f
          double: 64 bit used as the default data types for decimal values. default value is 0.0d
          boolean:  represent only one bit of information, there is only two possible value true or false used 
          for simple flags that track true/false conditions. default value is false 
          char:  16 bit   used to store any character A = 'A'
          
          
                                 Non-Primitive or Refrence data
          
          class objects
          Array
          stack
          
          Example:    Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe")
          
          
                                      JAVA Literals
          
          source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in code without
          any computation.
          example:   byte a = 68;
                     char a = 'a';
                     int decimal = 100;
                     int octal = 0144;
