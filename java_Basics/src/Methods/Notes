                                           Methods
                                           
     method is collection of statements that are grouped together to perform operation.
     
     creating method-----
     
       modifier, return type, method_name(parameters)
           {
               body
           }
       modifier---   define access type of method. it is optional to use.
       return type---  method may return a value
       parameters---  method may contain 0 parameters, it is type , order and number of parameters.
       body----   defines what the method does with the statements.
       
       
    Method calling---
        two way in which method is called----
        1) method returns a value
        2) method returning nothing
        
    Process of calling method------------
    
    when we called a method in that case controller will transferred to  that method and return a value 
    or reach closing braces and then controller will shit to the caller.
    
    two condition to execute method--
      1) the return statement is executed
      2) it reaches the method ending closing braces.
      
      
      
                                         Void key word
                                         
      it allow us to creat a method which do not return a value.
 NOTE---  call to void method must be a statement.
      
      
                                         This Key Word
                                         
      used as a reference to the object of the current class.
      with the help of this keyword we can differentiate b/w local var and instance var if they have 
      same names,within a constructor or methods.
 NOTE--- this keyword is used only within instance method or constructors.
